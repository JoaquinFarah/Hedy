# How Stoicism can help

"If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you're needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person." – Seneca
It's easy to feel overwhelmed at work. We process so much data every day, make so many decisions, and handle so many conflicting demands, that there's barely time to gather our thoughts.

If you've ever felt like this, chances are you could benefit from a pause. Just a few minutes to strip away all the stuff that's coming at you, and to focus on what really matters.

The ancient practice of Stoicism can help you to do just that. In this article, we introduce its key ideas, explain how to practice it, and outline the wide range of benefits it can bring.

What Is Stoicism?
Stoicism dates from the third century B.C. As a "school" of philosophy, it was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium, and was gradually developed by classical thinkers such as Heraclitus, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius.

In recent years, Stoicism has been championed by business gurus and opinion-formers such as Tim Ferriss. They say that it can help us to be resilient, to develop open and honest working relationships, and to remain calm and focused under pressure.

Stoic philosophy holds that there are four main virtues: wisdom, self-discipline, justice, and courage. Stoics try to live according to these four cardinal principles:

Wisdom, involving the application of reason – which Stoics believe is the only way to develop a true understanding of the world.
Self-discipline, requiring the Stoic to overcome irrational desires.
Justice, which means managing all our relationships with a commitment to fairness and duty.
Courage – essential to help us overcome irrational fears.
Another key facet of Stoic thinking is that we should divide our experience of the world into things which are realistically under our control, and things which are not. It makes no sense to let ourselves be emotionally affected by situations or circumstances over which we have no control.
