# Year in Review 2023
As memories from 2023 swirl around your head like the contents of your celebratory glass during the countdown to the new year, you may reflect on this year’s top technology trends. Unisys technology experts share insights and strategies on these trends all year long. 
This is the ideal time for people and organizations to pause and take a look back at the previous months to celebrate successes and make plans for change in the months to come. The editorial team at Unisys has applied this reflection to the blog posts that ran in 2023. Three technology topics captured people’s imagination and quickly emerged as the most popular of the year. Consider this recommended reading – or re-reading if you’ve already checked out some of these posts – to inspire your strategic planning for the coming year.

## Topic #1 – Quantum computing: Data processing at the speed of quantum

A quantum computer can process data and problem-solve at an accelerated rate far beyond what a classical computer can – using quantum bits or qubits rather than binary bits (0s and 1s). When applied to the right challenges, quantum computing can revolutionize how organizations run.

In “Improving business performance with quantum-enabled solutions and AI” Unisys CEO Peter Altabef writes about how combining quantum computing, big data and AI will result in “not just revolutionary but transformative” business solutions. Quantum computing will help organizations analyze and solve problems previously considered impossible to solve with computer power. 

"We are on the cusp of perhaps an even more powerful paradigm-shifting innovation – quantum computing," Altabef wrote. "[It] introduces a novel computational environment in which tools like AI will operate. As an emerging technology, quantum computing also promises to reshape the very landscape of business operations across sectors.”

Check out “Quantum advantage: What to know before problem-solving gets turbocharged" to learn quantum fundamentals, including key terms, and explore “Cracking the quantum conundrum: Finding the right use cases for your business” for the key factors that can help you determine whether the technology is right for you. This blog post also covers three promising industry use cases. These include:

Logistics management: Quantum computing can arrive at the most optimal solution from the potentially millions of possibilities, such as when you’re coordinating the routing of three trucks to 15 locations. One way to harness quantum computing to power your logistics is with Unisys Logistics OptimizationTM, which enables you to optimize your capacity, routes and warehouse usage.
Risk management: Quantum computing can analyze the massive volumes of data produced in the financial services industry. Financial institutions can use the resulting real-time analysis to help prevent financial losses and improve investment portfolio performance.
Product optimization: Quantum computing can run simulations on possible scenarios so you can optimize your development process, finetune your product and predict possible impacts. One example is drug trials in the pharmaceutical industry. 


## Topic #2: Artificial intelligence: Problem-solving for the workforce’s top challenges

Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked people’s hopes and fears in perhaps equal measure. Still, everyone can agree it will have a significant impact on how people work in the future. AI can contribute to successful business outcomes if you prioritize your data. Explore insights on solidifying that AI-data connection by reading “Fanning the flames of innovation: Three ways to strengthen the AI and data bond.” These insights include steps to integrate AI into your organization.

Find additional AI strategies focused on attaining business objectives in “Maximizing business value with AI-driven data strategies.” This blog post also includes steps to take as part of a well-designed AI strategy: 

Consider the ethical, organizational, leadership, cultural and legal implications of AI strategy implementation. 
Create a roadmap for developing, deploying and scaling AI applications, as well as addressing the ethical and legal implications of AI. 
Set up organizational change management (OCM) for a successful implementation. For guidance on encouraging AI adoption among your employees, read “OCM for AI: The who, why and how of employee adoption.”
Identify use cases – consider starting with analytic use cases and then evolving to more advanced analytics such as predictive analytics and machine learning models. 
Some of the more promising use cases for AI directly add immeasurable value to people, including using it to tackle bias and advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace and to transform child welfare by identifying risks early and implementing preventative measures. 


## Topic #3 – Hybrid work: Support the modern way people work 

The conversation of hybrid work – where employees spend part of the week in the office and another part at home – wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the Unisys hybrid work study, From Surviving to Thriving in Hybrid Work, completed in partnership with HFS Research this year. The study, which sought feedback from both employers and employees, is explored further in the podcast “3 tips for engaging your hybrid workforce in 2023.”

The blog post “Survey says? 5 key findings from our hybrid work study” offered the following survey takeaways: 

Hybrid work has become THE workplace model, with most employers planning to maintain a hybrid workplace model and 87% of employees surveyed saying it’s effective. 
Employees want access to more technology tools – including web-based video collaboration tools (76%), video conferencing (67%) and smart assistants/chatbots (60%) – so they can collaborate and work more efficiently.
Restrictive security policies come at a productivity price. Establishing corporate policies to strengthen data security is important when employees work remotely for part of the week. However, employees say these policies “always” or “often” (33%) present barriers to their ability to share files and sign into systems easily, regardless of work location. 
Technology issues cost employees – and organizations – hours of productivity. In fact, almost half of employees (49%) spend one to five hours a week working to resolve IT issues. Approximately 23% spend more than six hours a week on these issues. 
Employee experience (EX) programs can increase engagement and productivity. The physical workspace, company culture and technology deployments are all critical for EX. Organizations with “very mature” EX programs produce more engaged employees (74%). 
Supporting your hybrid workers with a positive work environment can lead to increased satisfaction and productivity. Find steps for HR professionals to take in “3 ways to help employees thrive in hybrid work,” including driving employee empowerment with technology. 

A popular technology organizations implement to support these workers is a unified communication and collaboration (UCC) platform like Microsoft Teams or Zoom, which enables employees to connect, whether they’re across town or across the globe. Explore the fundamental link between UCC and experience parity in “How collaboration platform data can help optimize your hybrid work model.”

## Cheers to technology triumphs to come in 2024 

In this industry, the landscape changes fast. In 2023, quantum computing, AI and hybrid work were the hottest topics. As impactful as these technology trends are, you can look forward to even more exciting developments to come – both with these topics and with many others.
